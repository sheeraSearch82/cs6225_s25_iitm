For the assignments, I would recommend cloning the [course
website](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs6225_s25_iitm), and find the assignments
under `assignments/pset*`. 

All assignments should be submitted through the [course
moodle]().

## Assignment late penalties

We are flexible about submitting assignments late. Unless otherwise specified,
assignments may be turned in late with the following penalties applied to the
score received:

* 1 day late: −5%
* 2 days late: −15%
* 3 days late: −30%
* 4 days late: −50%
* &gt; 4 days late: we will not grade it. 

I plan to discuss the assignment solution in class in the week following the
assignment due date. Hence, submissions submitted later than 4 days after the
deadline will not be accepted. 

## Academic Integrity

You're studying an advanced course; you’re expected and encouraged to discuss
your work with others. That said, **everything you write for this course (code,
written assignments, quizzes, exams and everything else) must be your own
original work.**

**Properly attribute any work that you use**. It is part of your job as a
scholar to understand what counts as plagiarism, and make sure you avoid it.
